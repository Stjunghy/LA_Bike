# LA_Bike

http://bikefun.herokuapp.com

We created a web app that analyzes LA Metro's Bike data (passholder types, bike trips and routes)

-Utilized Leaflet Javascript to create a map of Los Angeles neighborhoods/boundaries, along with Web Scraping
-Visualizations include a Python Flask powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB database.
-Included user-driven interaction (e.g. menus, dropdowns, textboxes, etc.)
